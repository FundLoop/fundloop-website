# Session Log - dev

## 2026-05-25T16:49:36.722Z - Branch-scoped session-log migration

- agent: Codex
- branch: dev
- head: a3fb9fe
- summary: Migrated this repo to branch-scoped session logs, archived the legacy monolithic log when present, documented the new workflow, and added PR version-bump automation.
- validation: Generated migration artifacts were inspected by script; run `node .github/scripts/pr-version-bump.mjs --base dev --dry-run` and `node .github/scripts/pr-version-bump.mjs --base main --dry-run` after migration.
- follow-ups: Future agents should append new entries to this branch log before each commit and keep completed work out of archived legacy logs.
