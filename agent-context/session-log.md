# session-log.md
Agents populate one level-3 heading for each coding session, following the same format each time. Each session bumps the version and includes plain text descriptions of:
- objective

- reflections
- suggested next steps

### session v4: Address PR #12 review comments on the pre-crypto branch
- timestamp: 2026-03-24T16:45:00-04:00
- agent: **Codex (GPT-5)**
- branch: **codex/dev**
- head: 5b37589d0aa56a9ef90df9bffe16056a67196e22 - Clean up and enrich seed data

#### Objective
Apply only the outstanding review-comment fixes for PR #12 on top of the pre-crypto branch, while preserving the later footer, onboarding follow-up, and crypto work on a separate branch.

#### Actions Taken
- Created and preserved a separate `codex/crypto-payment-flows` branch for the later work, then reset `codex/dev` back to `5b37589` so the PR #12 fixup commit could stay narrowly scoped.
- Restored the expected throw-on-error semantics in `lib/db-utils.ts` so admin callers do not silently receive `{ data, error }` objects where they previously expected exceptions.
- Fixed the organizations admin table relation loading with explicit foreign-key hints and safer object/array handling, and guarded the empty `.in()` path in the users admin table.
- Removed the no-op modal `aria-describedby` prop, tightened dialog header structure, and changed support form submissions to persist a nullable IP address instead of the literal string `"unknown"`.
- Replaced duplicated local `buildUrl` helpers with a shared `lib/url.ts` helper and updated the onboarding entry points to use it.
- Cleaned the contributor docs by replacing absolute local README links and updating the contribution notes to include `pnpm typecheck` as a required validation step.
- Reworked project-onboarding publish to enforce a minimum pledge percentage and use a new transactional database function for atomic organization/project/member/category creation.
- Optimized team-member project search so it only loads the specific user rows needed for contact resolution instead of selecting the entire users table.
- Added forward-only Supabase migrations for the atomic publish RPC and nullable support-request IP addresses, and updated `types/supabase.ts` accordingly.

#### Tests and Validation Notes
- `pnpm eslint README.md CONTRIBUTING.md lib/db-utils.ts components/admin/organizations-table.tsx components/admin/users-table.tsx components/modal.tsx app/support/page.tsx components/user-signup.tsx components/project-signup.tsx components/hero.tsx app/join/page.tsx components/onboarding-modal-manager.tsx app/actions/onboarding-actions.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

#### Reflections
- Resetting the branch before applying the fixes kept the PR history clean, but it also meant the review fixes had to be reapplied against the older pre-crypto file state.
- The atomic publish RPC meaningfully reduces the chance of partially-created org/project records during onboarding failures.

#### Suggested Next Steps
- Push this review-fix branch and resolve the corresponding GitHub review threads on PR #12.
- Keep later feature work isolated on `codex/crypto-payment-flows` until it is ready for its own PR.

### session v3: Upgrade stack, canonicalize Supabase, and implement resumable onboarding
- timestamp: 2026-03-24T10:14:56-04:00
- agent: **Codex (GPT-5)**
- branch: **codex/dev**
- head: b047f558c9241aff27b197a6ef5af28825759edd - Remove legacy database directory

#### Objective
Bring the repo out of mothballs by upgrading the stack, making `supabase/` the canonical database source, and replacing the shallow signup flows with a resumable onboarding system for people and projects.

#### Actions Taken
- Upgraded the application stack to current major versions, including Next 16, Tailwind 4, Vitest 4, Zod 4, React Day Picker 9, Vaul 1, and the modern Supabase SSR flow.
- Reworked repo tooling so `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and `build` are real gates again, and added CI plus baseline repo artifacts like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.editorconfig`, and `.nvmrc`.
- Pulled the linked remote schema into `supabase/migrations/20260324035725_initial_remote.sql`, cleaned that migration so it replays locally, and regenerated `types/supabase.ts`.
- Rebuilt `supabase/seed.sql` as a smaller `public`-only seed and removed the legacy `database/` directory from the repo.
- Added onboarding draft tables and user lifecycle changes in `supabase/migrations/20260324213000_resumable_onboarding.sql`, including owner-only RLS and inactive-by-default auth-created users.
- Added server-side onboarding actions, shared onboarding payload/screen models, and route-driven modal orchestration for user and project onboarding.
- Replaced the old user/project signup flows with multi-screen onboarding UIs that autosave, branch between individual/team-member/create-project paths, and show split-screen live previews on the form-heavy steps.
- Updated navbar, auth redirects, join flow, and my-profile handling so inactive users are treated as still onboarding and are routed back into the draft flow instead of falling into a broken profile state.
- Ran local verification with `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`, and used Playwright to confirm the new query-driven onboarding modal behavior in the local app.
- Linked this working copy to the FundLoop Supabase project and repaired the remote migration history so the pulled baseline migration is marked as applied.

#### Tests and Validation Notes
- `pnpm lint` passed
- `pnpm typecheck` passed
- `pnpm test` passed
- `pnpm build` passed
- Playwright confirmed the onboarding modal opens via query params, renders the intro/auth shell, and closes back to the base route
- Local Supabase migration replay succeeded through both tracked migrations after cleaning dump-specific commands from the pulled baseline migration

#### Reflections
- The repo is now structurally in a much better place, but remote database drift is still the main operational blocker.
- The onboarding code is implemented, but full remote-backed draft testing is blocked until the onboarding migration is pushed to the linked Supabase project.
- The local seed still needs a follow-up cleanup because the current `COPY ... FROM stdin` dump format is not replaying cleanly through the local Supabase seed runner.

#### Suggested Next Steps
- Push `20260324213000_resumable_onboarding.sql` to the linked remote project once the remote Postgres password is available to the Supabase CLI.
- Re-run authenticated Playwright coverage against the real remote-backed onboarding flow after that push.
- Convert `supabase/seed.sql` into a replayable seed format for local Supabase resets.

### session v1: Remove legacy database directory
- timestamp: 2026-03-24T10:00:00-04:00
- agent: **Codex (GPT-5)**
- branch: **codex/dev**
- head: b047f558c9241aff27b197a6ef5af28825759edd - Remove legacy database directory

#### Objective
Set up the project with a supabase database managed through git migrations.

#### Actions Taken
- Pull in the latest supabase schema from remote, 
- Pull in the current data from remote to form, prune unnccessary files and create a new seed.sql file
- Added this file (session-log.md) and created backdated entries for the last few sessionss

#### Tests and Validation Notes
- Tested locally by spinning up local supabase in docker

#### Reflections
- TBD

#### Suggested Next Steps
- Push the updated migrations to remote
